1. To login to Hortonworks using Cygwin.
   ssh root@localhost -p 2222
   or
   ssh root@127.0.0.1 -p 2222
   enter the password (default is hadoop).
   
   Use maria_dev for spark features.
   
   from vmware, ssh maria_dev@192.168.59.129 -p 2222

2. Transferring files from FileZilla to HortonWorks.
Add Host as "sftp://127.0.0.1"
Add username and password as maria_dev
Add port as 2222.

Select the Hortonworks folder to copy into and then right click on the folder from windows and press upload.

Alternatively we can use scp command, but its not working for me.
scp -P 2222 C:\Venkatesh\Data maria_dev@127.0.0.1/home/maria_dev/data

3. To use HiveContext from sqlContext, declare as below.
val sqlContext = new org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveContext(sc)

4. To start spark-shell with avro packages in itversity.
spark-shell --master yarn --conf spark.ui.port=12345 --packages com.databricks:spark-avro_2.10:2.0.1
