1. Import all tables from mysql database into hdfs as avro data files. use compression and the compression codec should be snappy. 
data warehouse directory should be retail_stage.db

sqoop import-all-tables \
--connect jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1/retail_db \
--username retail_dba --password cloudera \
--warehouse-dir /user/hive/warehouse/retail_stage.db \
--as-avrodatafile \
--compress \
--compression-codec org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.SnappyCodec 

2. Create a metastore table that should point to the orders data imported by sqoop job above. Name the table orders_sqoop. 

hadoop fs -get /user/hive/warehouse/retail_stage.db/orders/part-m-00000.avro /home/cloudera/arun/prob3

avro-tools getschema /home/cloudera/arun/prob3/part-m-00000.avro > /home/cloudera/arun/prob3/orders.avsc

create database retail_stage;
use retail_stage;

create table orders_sqoop 
stored as avro
location "/user/hive/warehouse/retail_stage.db/orders"
tblproperties ('avro.schema.url'='/user/cloudera/problem3/orders.avsc');


3. Write query in hive that shows all orders belonging to a certain day. This day is when the most orders were placed. 
select data from orders_sqoop. 

4. query table in impala that shows all orders belonging to a certain day. This day is when the most orders were placed. 
select data from order_sqoop. 
5. Now create a table named retail.orders_avro in hive stored as avro, the table should have same table definition as order_sqoop. 
Additionally, this new table should be partitioned by the order month i.e -> year-order_month.(example: 2014-01)

6. Load data into orders_avro table from orders_sqoop table.

7. Write query in hive that shows all orders belonging to a certain day. This day is when the most orders were placed. 
select data from orders_avro

8. evolve the avro schema related to orders_sqoop table by adding more fields named (order_style String, order_zone Integer)

9. insert two more records into orders_sqoop table. 

10. Write query in hive that shows all orders belonging to a certain day. This day is when the most orders were placed. 
select data from orders_sqoop

11. query table in impala that shows all orders belonging to a certain day. This day is when the most orders were placed. 
select data from orders_sqoop
