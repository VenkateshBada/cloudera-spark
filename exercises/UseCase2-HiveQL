Problem) Get daily revenue by product considering completed and closed orders.
Data needs to be sorted in ascending order by date and then descending by revenue for each product that day..
Data should be delimited by "," in this order; order_date, daily_revenue_per_product, product_name..


select to_date(C.order_date), D.product_name, C.subtotal from products D 
join 
(select A.order_date, B.order_item_product_id, cast(sum(B.order_item_subtotal) as float) subtotal 
from order_items B join 
(select order_id, order_date from orders where order_status = 'COMPLETE' or order_status = 'CLOSED' ) A 
on A.order_id = B.order_item_order_id
group by A.order_date, B.order_item_product_id 
order by A.order_date, B.order_item_product_id desc) C 
on D.product_id = C.order_item_product_id;

need to add "," delimiter and store the data onto a file.

Better query with joins on three table together.

SELECT o.order_date, p.product_id, p.product_name, round(sum(oi.order_item_subtotal),2)
FROM orders o JOIN order_items oi
ON o.order_id = oi.order_item_order_id
JOIN products p ON p.product_id = oi.order_item_product_id
WHERE o.order_status IN ("COMPLETE", "CLOSED")
GROUP BY o.order_date, p.product_id, product_name 
ORDER BY o.order_date, p.product_id desc;
