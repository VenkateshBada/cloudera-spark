Exercise 05 - Develop word count program
Data is available in HDFS /public/randomtextwriter
Get word count for the input data using space as delimiter (for each word, we need to get how many types it is repeated 
in the entire input data set)
Number of executors should be 10
Executor memory should be 3 GB
Executor cores should be 20 in total (2 per executor)
Number of output files should be 8

val data = sc.textFile("/user/cloudera/data-master/crime").flatMap(r => r.split(",")).flatMap(r => r.split(" ")).map(r => (r,""))

val wordCountList = data.countByKey.toList
val wordCountRDD = sc.parallelize(wordCountList)

#Need to use coalesce(8, true) as requirement is to store in 8 output files.
val wordCountDF = wordCountRDD.coalesce(8, true).toDF

#Writing to avro need databricks plugin.
wordCountDF.write.format("com.databricks.spark.avro").save("/user/cloudera/Practice/exercise5/sol1")
